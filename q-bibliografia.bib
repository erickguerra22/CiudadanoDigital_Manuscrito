  abstract  = {Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge. A critical yet underexplored challenge in RAG is document segmentation, also known as document chunking. Existing widely-used rule-based chunking methods usually lead to suboptimal splits, where overly large chunks introduce irrelevant information and small chunks lack semantic coherence. Existing semantic-based approaches either require costly LLM calls or fail to adaptively group contextually related sentences. To address these limitations, we propose PIC, Pseudo-Instruction for document Chunking), a simple yet effective method that leverages document summaries as pseudo-instructions to guide chunking. By computing semantic similarity between sentences and the summary, PIC dynamically groups sentences into chunks that align with the document{'}s key themes, ensuring semantic completeness and relevance to potential user instructions. Experiments on multiple open-domain question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that PIC can significantly improve retrieval accuracy (Hits@k) and end-to-end QA performance (Exact Match) without any additional training.}

  abstract = {Chatbots are a promising technology with the potential to enhance workplaces and everyday life. In terms of scalability and accessibility, they also offer unique possibilities as communication and information tools for digital learning. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review investigating the areas of education where chatbots have already been applied, explore the pedagogical roles of chatbots, the use of chatbots for mentoring purposes, and their potential to personalize education. We conducted a preliminary analysis of 2678 publications to perform this literature review, which allowed us to identify 74 relevant publications for chatbots’ application in education. Through this, we address five research questions that, together, allow us to explore the current state-of-the-art of this educational technology. We conclude our systematic review by pointing to three main research challenges: 1. Aligning chatbot evaluations with implementation objectives, 2. Exploring the potential of chatbots for mentoring students, and 3. Exploring and leveraging adaptation capabilities of chatbots. For all three challenges, we discuss opportunities for future research.}

It aims to organize critical information that is a necessary background for further research activity in the field of chatbots. More specifically, while giving the historical evolution, from the generative idea to the present day, we point out possible weaknesses of each stage. After we present a complete categorization system, we analyze the two essential implementation technologies, namely, the pattern matching approach and machine learning. Moreover, we compose a general architectural design that gathers critical details, and we highlight crucial issues to take into account before system design. Furthermore, we present chatbots applications and industrial use cases while we point out the risks of using chatbots and suggest ways to mitigate them. Finally, we conclude by stating our view regarding the direction of technology so that chatbots will become really smart.}
